## Dijkstra's Algorithm - Multi-node Pathway

Utilizing the Distance Vector Algorithm to find the most cost-efficient path between multiple nodes. Ability to view 
that node's neighbors, update the cost to travel to its neighbors, and refresh it's information to all the nodes involved.

<b>Note:</b> The program is set to update automatically every 30 seconds to ensure each node has the most up-to-date information

### Menu-Input Options Available / Functional:
 - <b>print</b> - Print Current Node's DV Table
 - <b>refresh</b> - Send Current Node's DV Table of Neighbors
 - <b>update</b> - Update Current Node's DV table
 - <b>route</b> - Display's the lowest cost route to desired node and which node to hop to
 
 Note: Menu-input text is not case sensitive, menu will handle any lowercase or uppercase discrepancies.
