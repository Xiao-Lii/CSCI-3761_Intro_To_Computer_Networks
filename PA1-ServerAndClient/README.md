# CSCI 3761 - Intro to Computer Networks - PA#2 - Dijkstra's Algorithm - Multi-node Pathway

Utilizing Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the most cost-efficient path between multiple nodes. Ability to view that node's neighbors, update the cost to travel to its neighbors, and refresh it's information to all the nodes involved.

Note: The program is set to update automatically every 30 seconds to ensure each node has the most up-to-date information.
